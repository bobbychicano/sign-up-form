##Sign Up Form

The purpose of this project is to implement my knowledge of intermediate HTML & CSS abilities. This sign-up form is for an imaginary service.

This layout was achieved using flexbox. I had a particularly difficult time importing an icon on the left-hand side of the page due to having use the 'opacity' property for the container div. It was resulting in my image also being opaque and unable to be seen.

I also struggled with knowing whether to use a <legend> element or not. Additionally, I broke the <button> element out of the <form> element so that I could style the background of the input group to be a white color. I'm not sure if there is a best practice that I broke there, or if it was ok. I think a code review to simplify my CSS code in particular could be helpful.
